Create a web developer portfolio web site. The general design vibe should be modern and elegant.

The first page includes a navigation top bar: to the left put the logo, that is an inverted K letter and an M letter, both letters inside the same circle. To the right of the navigation top bar add two navigation buttons: Case Studies and Let's work together.

The main content should include at the top left a rounded image, let's put an avatar in it. Below we'll have the presentation text:

"Hi, I’m Manuel Krapovickas! I’m a front-end developer with a creative background as a professional musician.

Based in Barcelona, I specialize in building responsive and accessible web interfaces using technologies like React, Next.js, Angular and Tailwind CSS.

After completing a top-ranked bootcamp at IT Academy and working on agile projects at Barcelona Activa, I’ve continued to grow as a developer through freelance work.

I’m currently collaborating on the Extended Bandoneon project, where I design and build browser-based audio tools that blend technology and music.

I enjoy turning ideas into functional, user-friendly applications — always with clean code and thoughtful design."

At the bottom add a footer: to the left the same logo as in the navigation top nav, to the right side an email address and a phone number.
